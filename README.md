  - Data input/output
  - Basic mathematical calculations
  - String manipulation

## Project Structure

The repository contains a series of activities, each representing progressively more complex R programming exercises:

- **Activity #01**: Introduction to basic R syntax and arithmetic operations
- **Activity #02**: More advanced operations and control structures
- **Activity #03**: Vector manipulation and iterative operations
- **Activity #04**: Data collection, categorization, and analysis with user input

## Running the Code

Each R script (.r file) can be executed in RStudio or any R-compatible environment:

1. Open the .r file in RStudio
2. Run the script using the `source()` function or by selecting and running code sections
3. Follow any prompts for user input where required
